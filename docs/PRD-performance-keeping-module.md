## 0. Quick Start Briefing

### What is Performance Keeping?

Performance Keeping is Kivi Media's systematic tracking of all operational, marketing, sales, content, and client performance data. It currently lives in **19 Google Sheets** with **~103 tabs** and **309 tracked columns**. This PRD defines how KM Boards should automate ~58% of this tracking (38% fully automated + 20% semi-automated).

### Key Numbers

| Classification | Columns | Percent | What it means |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| AUTO | 118 | 38% | Can be fully automated (dates, URLs, calculations, attachments) |
| SEMI-AUTO | 61 | 20% | Need a human trigger, then auto-complete (status toggles, assignments) |
| HUMAN-REQUIRED | 127 | 41% | Require human input (client names, notes, judgments) -- KM Boards sends reminders |
| NOTIFY | 3 | 1% | Should trigger real-time notifications (red flags on ticket tracker) |

### Account Managers Identified

Angel, Kath(lyn), Devi, Hilda, Riza, Sarah, Ela, Ivy, Mariz -- each has dedicated tabs in Fathom Video, Client Updates, Sanity Checks, and Sanity Test sheets.

### Top Automation Opportunities

1. **Date/time columns** (AUTO) -- Auto-populate dates, weeks, and time periods across all trackers
2. **Boolean completion flags** (AUTO) -- Sanity check done, email notification received, test pass/fail
3. **URL/attachment columns** (AUTO) -- Website links, form links, report attachments, screenshots
4. **Calculated fields** (AUTO) -- Completion percentages, durations, progress summaries
5. **Status/method dropdowns** (SEMI-AUTO) -- On-time status, communication method, device type
6. **Assignment fields** (SEMI-AUTO) -- Account Manager assignment, workflow triggers
7. **Red flag notifications** (NOTIFY) -- Type of Red Flag on Flagged Tickets Tracker should alert managers immediately

### Suggested First Tasks

1. **Import the Masterlist structure** into KM Boards as a "Performance Hub" dashboard with live status indicators
2. **Build data models** for the Daily-frequency trackers (Fathom Videos, Client Updates, Ticket Updates) -- highest use, ~90 columns
3. **Implement the Data Pull Agent** for AUTO columns -- sync dates, URLs, booleans, and calculations from Google Sheets
4. **Set up the Reminder Agent** for HUMAN-REQUIRED columns -- per-AM daily digest of pending inputs
5. **Build the notification system** for NOTIFY columns -- real-time red flag alerts to managers
6. **Weekly-frequency trackers** (Sanity Checks, PICS.IO, Weekly Tickets) -- ~120 columns, second batch

### Suggested Schema Build Order

```
-- Priority 1: Core lookup tables
performance_clients
performance_account_managers

-- Priority 2: Daily trackers
performance_fathom_videos
performance_client_updates
performance_ticket_updates

-- Priority 3: Weekly trackers
performance_sanity_checks
performance_sanity_tests
performance_daily_goals
performance_pics_monitoring

-- Priority 4: Monthly/Quarterly
performance_google_ads
performance_pingdom
performance_flagged_tickets
performance_monthly_summaries
```

### Migration Strategy (3 phases)

1. **Phase 1 (Bridge)**: KM Boards reads from Google Sheets API, displays in new dashboard. No disruption to current workflow.
2. **Phase 2 (Primary)**: KM Boards becomes primary data entry. Sheets become read-only mirrors.
3. **Phase 3 (Retire)**: Sheets archived. KM Boards is sole source of truth.

## 1. Executive Summary

"Performance Keeping" is Kivi Media's term for what bookkeeping is to finances, but applied to business performance metrics. It is the systematic tracking of all operational, marketing, sales, content, and client performance data across the agency and its clients.

This PRD documents the complete Google Sheets ecosystem used for Performance Keeping, covering **19 spreadsheets** with **~103 tabs** and **309 tracked columns**. The analysis shows that approximately **38%** of all tracking can be fully automated, **20%** can be semi-automated with human triggers, and **41%** requires human judgment. An additional **1%** (3 columns) should trigger notifications when values change.

## 4. KM Boards Module Design

### 4.1 Data Model

Based on the crawled sheets, the Performance Keeping module needs tables that mirror the tracker structure. Common patterns observed:

**Fields appearing across multiple sheets** (candidates for shared data model):

| Field Pattern | Appears in # tabs | Sheets |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| CLIENT / Client | 33+ | Client Updates, Sanity Checks, Sanity Test, Pingdom, Update Schedule, PICS.IO, etc. |
| NOTES / Notes / Remarks | 25+ | Nearly all trackers |
| DATE / Date / Date Sent | 24+ | Nearly all trackers |
| BUSINESS NAME | 10 | Sanity Checks (9) + AM_Clients_Websites_Status |
| SANITY CHECK DONE / Sanity test (DONE) | 16 | Sanity Checks (9) + KM Sanity Test (7) |
| Website / Website Link / Page Link | 12+ | Sanity Test, Holiday, AM Clients, Pingdom |
| Email Notification received | 9 | KM Sanity Test (all tabs) |
| Mobile/Desktop | 8 | KM Sanity Test (all tabs) |
| Thank you page is present | 5 | KM Sanity Test (5 tabs) |
| UPDATE SENT ON TIME? | 8 | Client Updates (all AM tabs) |
| METHOD (Email,Whatsapp,etc.) | 8 | Client Updates (all AM tabs) |
| Account Manager | 4 | Update Schedule, Pingdom (x2), AM_Clients |
| SPARK CLIENTS | 6 | Ticket Update Tracker (monthly tabs) |
| Duration | 3 | PICS.IO (per-person tabs) |

**Proposed core tables**:

```sql
-- Shared lookup
performance_clients (id, name, business_name, website_url, account_manager_id, status)
performance_account_managers (id, name, user_id)

-- Per-tracker type
performance_fathom_videos (id, client_id, meeting_date, date_watched, watched, action_items_sent, link, notes, account_manager_id)
performance_client_updates (id, client_id, date_sent, on_time, method, notes, account_manager_id)
performance_sanity_checks (id, client_id, date, business_name, done, notes, account_manager_id)
performance_sanity_tests (id, client_id, date, website, form_link, test_done, email_received, device, layout_status, thank_you_page, notes, account_manager_id)
performance_daily_goals (id, date, designer_dev, commitment, link, updated, completed, percent, remarks)
performance_pingdom (id, test_date, client_id, website, account_manager_id, report_attachment, notes)
performance_google_ads (id, month, client_id, account_manager_id, report_sent)
performance_ticket_updates (id, week_start, account_manager_id, client_type, client_id, updated)
performance_flagged_tickets (id, date_range, name, project_ticket_id, red_flag_type, ticket_count, reasonable, description, team_type)
performance_pics_monitoring (id, week, date, client_id, duration, notes, account_manager_id)
```

### 4.2 Dashboards & Views

- **Performance Keeping Hub** (replaces Masterlist): Overview of all trackers with status, freshness, and links
- **Per-client performance views**: Aggregated metrics per client across all trackers (sanity checks + updates + fathom + speed tests)
- **Per-AM views**: Account Manager workload dashboard showing all their clients and tracker statuses
- **Time-based views**: Weekly, monthly, quarterly roll-ups with trends
- **Stale data alerts**: Highlight trackers that haven't been updated on schedule (based on Frequency from Masterlist)
- **Red Flag dashboard**: Real-time view of flagged tickets across Designers, Developers, and Video Editors

### 4.3 Automation Agents

| Agent | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Data Pull Agent | Scheduled (daily/weekly) | Fetches data from Google Sheets API, syncs AUTO columns |
| Calculation Agent | On data change | Runs formulas (completion %, aggregations, comparisons) |
| Reminder Agent | Scheduled + event | Sends notifications for HUMAN-REQUIRED inputs that are due/overdue |
| Report Agent | Scheduled (weekly/monthly) | Generates periodic summaries and client reports |
| Anomaly Agent | On data change | Flags unusual patterns (missed sanity checks, overdue updates, red flag spikes) |
| Sync Agent | Bi-directional | Writes KM Boards changes back to Google Sheets during Phase 1-2 bridge period |

### 4.4 Notification & Reminder System

- **NOTIFY triggers**: Alert stakeholders immediately when `Type of Red Flag` changes in the Flagged Tickets Tracker
- **HUMAN-REQUIRED reminders**: Based on the Frequency from the Masterlist Links tab:
  - Daily trackers (Fathom, Client Updates, Ticket Updates): Remind at 3PM if not filled
  - Twice-weekly (Operations Goals): Remind on due days
  - Weekly (Sanity Checks, PICS.IO): Remind Friday if not done
  - Monthly (Google Ads, Summary): Remind on 1st of month
  - Quarterly (Pingdom): Remind at quarter start
- **Smart batching**: Consolidate multiple reminders into a daily digest per Account Manager
- **Escalation**: If input not provided within 2x the expected frequency, escalate to manager (Ziv)

### 4.5 Migration Path

1. **Phase 1 (Bridge)**: KM Boards reads from Google Sheets via API, displays in new dashboard UI. All 19 sheets synced read-only.
2. **Phase 2 (Primary)**: KM Boards becomes primary data entry point. Sheets become read-only mirrors via Sync Agent. Start with Daily-frequency trackers.
3. **Phase 3 (Retire)**: Sheets retired, KM Boards is the sole source of truth. Archive sheet data.

## 5. Integration Requirements

Based on the data types and tracker names found across all 19 sheets:

| Integration | Purpose | Related Sheets | Priority |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Google Sheets API | Read/write sync for bridge period | All 19 sheets | Critical |
| Google Analytics / Fathom | Meeting video tracking, web analytics | KM Fathom Video Tracker | High |
| Trello | Ticket IDs, commitments links | Operations Goals, Flagged Tickets | High |
| Google Ads | Ad spend, conversions, monthly reports | Google Ads Monthly Report Tracker | High |
| Pingdom | Site speed monitoring, quarterly tests | QUARTERLY - Pingdom Speed Test | Medium |
| Pics.io | Digital asset management monitoring | PICS.IO Monitoring Sheet | Medium |
| Email platform (TBD) | Client update delivery tracking | KM Client Updates Tracker | Medium |
| GoHighLevel (GHL) | CRM integration, form submissions | KM Sanity Checks, Sanity Test | Medium |
| WhatsApp Business | Client communication method tracking | Client Updates (METHOD column) | Low |

| Operations Team | Designers (Mayvi, Jeez, Roy), Developers (Michael, Alyessa, Ela), Video Editors (Jena) | Daily goals, ticket tracking | Operations trackers |
| Clients | External | View their own performance data | Read-only, own data only |

**Account Manager to Client mappings** (from crawled data):

| Account Manager | Known Clients |
|----------------|---------------|
| Angel | David Meister, Laurie Ellington, Josh Staley, Beau Kramer |
| Devi | Caroline Ravn |
| Ela | Dustin Thibeault |
| Hilda | Tyler Hacker, Matt Radicelli, Julie Cylla, Sara Chana Silverstein, Lior Littman |
| Ivy | Beau Kramer, Karen Sawyer, Tim Huckabee, Dr. Willow Brown, Kerry Cameron, Caroline Ravn |

|----------|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Daily | Fathom Videos, Client Updates, Account Managers' Ticket Update Tracker | ~90 cols | High |
| 2 | Twice a Week | Operations Team Daily GoalsTracker | ~30 cols | Medium |
| 3 | Weekly | KM Sanity Checks, KM Sanity Test, PICS.IO Monitoring | ~120 cols | High |
| 4 | Monthly | Google Ads Monthly Report, MONTHLY SUMMARY | ~15 cols | Low |
| 5 | Quarterly | Pingdom Speed Test | ~20 cols | Low |
| 6 | Reference | Update Schedule, AM_Clients_Websites_Status, Google Analytics, Holiday Section, KM's Other Activities, Weekly Ticket Tracker | ~30 cols | Low |

### C. Formula Inventory

No formulas detected via the Google Sheets API. The sheets use Smart Chips and rich links rather than `HYPERLINK()` formulas. The Consolidated Summary and Records tabs in Operations Team Daily GoalsTracker appear to use internal Sheets formulas for aggregation (e.g., percentage calculations), but these are not exposed through the API's cell value reads.

### E. Unresolved Questions

1. Which external APIs/platforms does Kivi Media use for each channel? (Needed to build Data Pull Agent)
2. What is the desired notification frequency? (Daily digest vs. real-time alerts)
3. Are there any sheets not linked from the Masterlist that should be included?
4. What is the priority order for migrating trackers to KM Boards?
5. What CRM/project management tools are currently in use beyond Trello? (For integration planning)
6. Should the Tracking Dashboard tab (tab 1 of Masterlist) be replicated in KM Boards as a live dashboard, and how should it aggregate data?
7. The "KM's Other Activities" sheet contains reference/training content (Automator, Core Values, ChatGPT Agent Mode, GHL Quiz) rather than operational tracking data -- should it be included in the Performance Keeping module or treated as a separate knowledge base?
